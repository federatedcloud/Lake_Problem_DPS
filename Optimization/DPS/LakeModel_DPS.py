# Lake parameters
# b    : proportion of phosphorous retained in the lake each year;
# q    : steepness of the sigmoid curve, large values give a steeper slope;

# Parameters related to utiltiy
# delta : discount rate, set at 0.98
# alpha : utility from pollution, set at 0.4

# Lake state variabiles
# lake_state : phosphorous concentration in the lake at a given time step;
# initially set to 0

# Stochasticity is introduced by natural variability around anthropogenic pollution flow, 
# which is generated form a log-normal distribution 

# nYears : the time horizon for planning (100 years in this example)

# Decision variable
# vars : vector of length 3n describing the policy parameters
# n is the number of RBFs, each with a weight, center and radius
# format of vars is [c1, b1, w1, c2, b2, w2, ..., cn, bn, wn]
# all variables must be between 0 and 1, and all weights must sum to 1
# The weights determined by Borg aren't constrained to sum to 1,
# but are normalized to do so in the model simulation
# The actual decision, the amount of pollution emitted by the town, is Y,
# a function of vars and the current state of the lake (lake_state)

# Objectives
# 1: average discounted net benefit
# 2: maximum average P concentration
# 3: average inertia
# 4: average reliability

# Constraints
# Reliability must be > 85%
